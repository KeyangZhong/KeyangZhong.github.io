Summary: Environmental time series modeling of recirculating aquaculture systems provides the basis for the design of intelligent and foreseeable agricultural facilities. The modeling accuracy of environmental factors plays an important role, which could help grasp the environmental situation and change trend of the recirculating aquaculture system, assist in early warning when the environment factor level exceeds the normal data range, and combine with the control method to improve the accuracy of environmental control. The traditional time series model is difficult to predict complex situations, which is mainly due to the effective integration of multidimensional data. Our goal is to make improvements to the traditional time series model. The proposed multiple graph fusion network (GraphTS) fuses multi-sensor Spatio-temporal information using a multi-graph fusion method based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and graph attention neural network. We collected two recirculating aquaculture datasets with various features and applications to test GraphTSâ€™s performance. Comparing the average metrics of predictor outcomes of proposed GraphTS with the standard model LSTM, the average margin of error (AME) is reduced by 37% and 13%, and the Pearson correlation Coefficient (PCC) is improved to 97% and 96% for two datasets, respectively. The best results are also achieved on the discrete traffic prediction dataset. It shows the adaptability and multi-dimensional information gathering ability of GraphTS.
