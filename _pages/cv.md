# Competition Experience

**Computer vision – helmet detection**

*A competition about utilizing and enhancing the YOLO models for safety helmet detection*

- Employed YOLOV3, PPYOLO, PPYOLOE, and SSD models to detect targets in the safety helmet dataset.

- The backbone network of YOLOV3 was modified to MobileNet for object detection.
- Taking all factors into consideration, PPYOLO was used, resulting in a final average precision (AP) of 0.6781.

**Natural Language Processing – Medical Search Query Relevance Assessment**

*A competition on using deep learning models for medical search query relevance assessment.*

- Utilizing the pre-trained BERT model as the foundational architecture, semantic features were extracted.
- A simple fully connected layer and a sigmoid activation layer were added after the pooler layer for correlation analysis.
- The accuracy after model fusion is 0.8742, ranking 10th among 256 participants.
